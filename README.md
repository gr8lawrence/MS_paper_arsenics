## Abstract
Exposures to inorganic arsenic, a toxic metalloid found naturally in drinking water is a public health concern. In human, metabolism of inorganic arsenic is regularly seen as a detoxification pathway. Dietary intakes of folate, a B-vitamin that is present in many types of food and recommended to be taken daily for all adults and especially pregnant women, is found to interfere with the metabolic outcomes of this pathway. Understanding the genetic pattern shifts underlying elevated folate and arsenic exposures is an important task. Humanized mouse is a model organism that has been widely used to study the role of folate in inorganic arsenic metabolism in human. In this study, we use gene expression read counts from RNA materials in germ cell tissues of humanzed and wildtype C57BL/6N mice to investigate pattern shifts of gene expression in mice under different levels of dietary folate intakes and exposed to different levels of inorganic arsenic in drinking water. We found several differentially expressed genes and enriched gene sets in sperm and oocyte samples following the elevation of dietary folate at a fixed level of arsenic and across the increase of both folate and arsenic. A few gene sets whose annotated functions are related to epithelial to mesenchymal transition, responses to ultraviolet light, and early responses to estrogen appear to be consistently enriched in several comparisons. However, the discovered genes and gene sets do not advance any particular conjecture in biological functions, for which more investigations are needed.
